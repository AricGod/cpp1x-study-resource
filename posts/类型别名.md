{% include JB/setup %}

有两种方法可用于定义类型别名，第一种方法是使用`typedef`关键字，这个C++03就已经支持了。第二种方式是使用C++11新的声明方式`using`关键字。方法很简单，比如：

    using MyUint = unsigned int;

那么 MyUint 和 unsigned int 等价了。

随即，你可能想到了一个问题：`typedef`和`using`的区别在哪里?

我找了一个sof的帖子:[Difference between typedef and C++11 type alias [duplicate]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18287151/difference-between-typedef-and-c11-type-alia)

我想，上面的这段回复足够回答你的问题了。
